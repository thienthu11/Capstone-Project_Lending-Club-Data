### Capstone-Project_Lending-Club-Data
For this project I would like to dive into three points:
1/ What are relationships of each categories with the bank's approval decision? 
2/ How those categories effect the loan's default risk?
3/ I also want to predict the risk of loans being default based on the past loan data.

### The Data
For this project, I will use the loan data available from Lending Club's website (https://www.lendingclub.com/statistics/additional-statistics?).
The data files contain complete loan data for all loans issued from quater 2 of 2018 to Q1 2020. The data is a matrix of over 1 million observations and 150 variables. It contains variables such as loan amount, interest rate, credit score, the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.), latest payment information and so on. The name of the data file is Loans

a) D
b) Similar Distributions


II. Good Loans vs Bad Loans
a) Types of Loans
