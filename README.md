### Capstone-Project_Lending-Club-Data
I worked at the bank before and am always curious how the bank decides who they would approve and who they would decline for a loan. For that reason, I choose to work on this Lending Club data and I devide this project into three points:
1/ What are relationships of each categories with the bank's approval decision? 
2/ How those categories effect the loan's default risk?
3/ I also want to predict the risk of loans being default based on the past loan data. 

### Company Information:
Lending Club is a peer to peer lending company based in the United States, in which investors provide funds for potential borrowers and investors earn a profit depending on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). Lending Club provides the "bridge" between investors and borrowers. For more basic information about the company please check out the link below about the company.

### The Data
For this project, I will use the loan data available from Lending Club's website (https://www.lendingclub.com/statistics/additional-statistics?).
The data files contain complete loan data for all loans issued from quater 2 of 2018 to Q1 2020. The data is a matrix of over 1 million observations and 150 variables. It contains variables such as loan amount, interest rate, credit score, the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.), latest payment information and so on. The name of the data file is Loans

### Project Outline: 
I break this project down to 3 main parts: Exploring and observing, Analyzing main variables and Machine Learning_Modeling

I. Exploring and observing the data to understand more about the data: what information containt in the data, what type of the data and so on. This step will help me to pick important variables to build my models later on. Steps include in this part: creating meta data, converting variables to correct/needed type such as numeric, date, replacing missing values with 0 and defining default loans.


II. Analyzing main variables: I will look deeper into the default loans such as default rate based on grade and interest rate. I also check the relationship between annual income, interest rate, grade and loan amount, funded amount, funded amount invested.

III. Machine learning_Modeling: Logistic Regression, Linear Model, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Boosting.
